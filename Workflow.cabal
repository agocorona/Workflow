synopsis:    Monadic transformer for persistence in threads. and workflow patterns
description: Transparent support  for interruptible computations. A workflow can be seen as a persistent thread that executes any
             monadic computation. Therefore, it can be used in very time consuming computations such are CPU intensive calculations
             or procedures that are most of the time waiting for the action of a process or an user, that are prone to comunication
             failures, timeouts or shutdowns. It also can be used if you like to restart your
             program at the point where the user left it last time.
             .
             The computation can be restarted at the interrupted point thanks to its logged state in permanent storage.
             Besides that, the package also provides other services associated to workflows
             .
             This release inprove the logging/recovery process in workflows with with many steps
             .
             See "Control.Workflow" for details
