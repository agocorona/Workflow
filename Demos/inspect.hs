-- example of the Workflow package .
-- This demo shows inter-workflow communications.
-- two workflows that interact by inspecting its other's  state. One ask the user for a numbers.
-- When the total number of tries
-- is exhausted, update Data with termination and ends.
---It can end when termination comes from the other workflow. The other wait for "5", print
-- a message , update Data with termination to the other and finish. t
-- you can break the code at any moment. The flow will re-start in the last interrupted point
-- For bugs, questions, whatever, please email me: Alberto GÃ³mez Corona agocorona@gmail.com
