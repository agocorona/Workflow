-- this program imput numbers and calculate their factorials. The workflow control a record all the inputs and outputs
-- so that when the program restart, all the previous results are shown.
-- if the program abort by a runtime error or a power failure, the program will still work
-- enter 0 for exit and finalize the workflow (all the intermediate data will be erased)
-- enter any alphanumeric character for aborting and then re-start.
